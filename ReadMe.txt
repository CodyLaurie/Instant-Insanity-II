Please note that the times posted on my resume as benchmark are compiled in eclipse.
As I have run tests on many different machines (and am actually even undershooting on
the resume) You should be able to easily recreate these results on your own machine. 
Although obviously copilation results will vary by machine large descrepencies may be
attributed to which IDE you are using. Incase you are unaware VS Code, a common IDE 
among many of my peers is really not quite adequite for this level of analysis. This
is because Eclipse is a IDE specifically for Java and so its run times are much more
reliable and consistent than many others which rely on extentions or various other 
implementations. This ultimately results in compilation times over 4x slower than
a propper java IDE. Hope you enjoy.
